					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>My diverse background is an embodiment of my professional journey. I didn't quite know what I wanted to be, so when I graduated from my University, I joined a non-profit organization that focuses on mentoring college students.</p>
          <p>Through this non-profit, I developed soft skills of active listening and communication that allowed me to thrive in a career in sales. However, I grew tired of being a cog in a machine and set out to be an entrepreneur</p>
          <p>This lead me to specialize in marketing and real estate, which I run for my family business. As I focus on growing our company, I realized we needed to increase our digital presence. This eventually led me to Thinkful and the rest is history.</p>
          <p>During my free time, you can find me at my Muay Thai Gym or Karate Dojo. If I'm not there, I'm probably exploring Houston's best restaurants with my wife!</p>

          <p>Here are my top 3 Food Recs:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Handy's Dozo</li>
            <li>Pepper Lunch</li>
            <li>Mien</li>
